No pressure to be perfect — this is about practice, curiosity, and building confidence.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- Understand **what** JavaScript is and **why** it matters
- Create a JavaScript file (`script.js`)
- Link that file to your HTML
- Use:
  - `console.log()` for developer messages
  - `console.error()` for debugging
  - `alert()` for user-facing messages
- Open and use the browser console
- Verify that your JavaScript is connected and working

Remember: every JavaScript project starts the same way:
